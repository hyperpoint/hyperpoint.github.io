# Retrospective of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW-Era Fusion Programs and Project Cohorts

### Retrospective of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW-Era Fusion Programs and Project Cohorts

In an age where climate change and energy sustainability are at the forefront of global concerns, the efforts to enhance and commercialize fusion energy technologies have captivated the attention and imagination of scientists, policymakers, and investors alike. Between 2018 and 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) embarked on an ambitious journey to revolutionize the field of fusion energy through its BETHE and GAMOW programs. These initiatives not only accelerated technological advancements but also set a foundation for robust public-private partnerships enhancing the commercial viability of fusion energy.

Fusion energy, the process that powers our sun, offers a nearly limitless source of clean energy without the radioactive waste associated with traditional nuclear fission. Recognizing its potential, ARPA-E invested around $29 million in a range of innovative projects aimed at overcoming critical technical barriers to commercial fusion energy. Notable among these was the University of Houston’s pioneering work on advanced materials for high-field magnets, a critical component that could dramatically improve the efficiency and affordability of fusion reactors.

The BETHE (Breakthroughs Enabling THermonuclear-fusion Energy) and GAMOW (Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts) programs were particularly distinguished for their focus on scalability and market alignment. These programs underscored the importance of not only achieving technological breakthroughs but also ensuring that fusion technologies could be economically viable and widely accepted in the energy market.

Engaging with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from academia and industry to investors and the public, the ARPA-E initiatives focused on building a dynamic ecosystem around fusion energy. This included raising investor confidence by showcasing the commercial potential of fusion energy projects and stressing the importance of societal acceptance. The goal was clear: to expedite the transition of fusion from experimental labs to commercial grids.

Social acceptance is often a crucial hurdle in the adoption of new technologies, particularly in the energy sector where the impact on communities and ecosystems is direct and profound. ARPA-E’s proactive approach in engaging various community and interest groups helped demystify the technology and align public perception with the exciting possibilities that fusion energy presents.

Looking forward, the legacy of the BETHE and GAMOW programs offers compelling insights into the future of energy innovation. As the world grapples with the dual challenges of ensuring energy security and combating climate change, fusion energy stands out as a potentially transformative solution. The work done under these programs has laid a critical foundation, proving that with the right investment, policy support, and public engagement, the dream of harnessing the power of the stars here on Earth could become a reality within our lifetime.

Embracing the lessons from the BETHE and GAMOW programs, policymakers, researchers, and entrepreneurs have a blueprint for advancing fusion energy technologies from the lab to the marketplace. While significant challenges remain, the progress made in this era of ARPA-E’s investment has brought us closer than ever to a future powered by clean, abundant, and sustainable fusion energy.

As we reflect on the advancements and learnings of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW era, the path forward is promising and filled with the potential for groundbreaking achievements that could reshape our energy landscape and help secure a greener future for generations to come.
